# Neovim from scratch

This repository and accompanying tutorials outline the building blocks of modern Neovim for your personalized development environment. Each video is associated with a branch so checkout the one you are interested in, you can follow along with this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ). 

General Neovim support is available on our [Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#neovim-atmachine:matrix.org).

## Try out this config

This config requires [Neovim v0.8.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases). Please [upgrade](#upgrade-to-neovim-v080) if you're on an earlier version of the editor.

Clone the repository into the correct location (make a backup your current `nvim` directory if you want to keep it).

```
git clone https://github.com/NexushasTaken/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` in your terminal and wait for the plugins to be installed.

**NOTE** [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) is used to install and manage LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters via the `:Mason` command.

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

You'll probably notice you don't have support for copy/paste also that python and node haven't been setup

So let's fix that

First we'll fix copy/paste

- On mac `pbcopy` should be builtin

- On Ubuntu

  ```
  sudo apt install xsel
  ```

- On Arch Linux

  ```
  sudo pacman -S xsel
  ```
  
- Wayland users

### Upgrade to Neovim v0.8.0

Assuming you [built from source](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#quick-start), `cd` into the folder where you cloned `neovim` and run the following commands. 
```
git pull
make distclean && make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
git checkout v0.8.0
sudo make install
nvim -v
```
